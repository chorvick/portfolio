Next we dove into the server side of things with Nodejs and learned proper separation of client side vs. server side for security. I learned Sql and Nosql databases and how to make them communicate with my server side. We learned to make our own api's after we learned to call other public api's. Finally we learned templating engines first Handlebars then React.  We also covered the MVC framework and PWA's and various other ways of designing features on web applications for offline/online use and storage."
